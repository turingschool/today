Change of plans on homework. Let's push cryptography off for a day.

#### 1. Arrays & Hashes

You need to finish the short exercise from our [morning Arrays & Hashes session](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/arrays_and_hashes.markdown) (~10 minutes)

#### 2. Building a Car

You need to complete the [Car exercise from our afternoon Object-Oriented Programming session](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/object_oriented_programming.markdown) (~30 minutes)

#### 3. Testing Luhn

<div style="float:right; margin: 10px">
![Hans Peter Luhn](http://timoelliott.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hans-peter-luhn_8b9a8546-48b2-4bf2-9a87-bb7207d93634.jpg)
</div>

Lastly, look at that disapproving smirk from Hans Peter Luhn over there. Who would approve of an implementation of the Luhn algorithm that's not verified by automated tests? Nobody!

Build *a new implementation of the algorithm*, from scratch, using the ideas of *classes* and *tests* you worked on this afternoon. Use the spiraling test cases that we discussed in the final session of the day.

**Submission**: Create a [gist](http://gist.github.com) and add the URL for your Gist to [this MoPad document](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/vTl9MXkatz).
