## Self-Study (9:00 - 11:00)

This morning, please _respect the Friday_ and do not work on your project. You should, instead, choose one or more of the following:

### Join a Study Group

* **Alan** is running a Machine Learning study group. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data. Wave of the future.
* **Will** is running a Clojure study group. You don't need any experience with Clojure to participate. Learning a functional language is a mind-expanding experience and will make you a better Rubyist. Clojure has been getting a lot of love from the Ruby community. Join Will and see what all the fuss is about.
* **Andy** is running a study group on working with geospatial data. Like maps? Locate Andy.

(Let Steve know if you'd like to run a study group.)

### Work with a Peer Mentor

* **Robert** has offered to mentor students from 1407, 1409, and 1410. Seek him out if there is something you're struggling with or if you want to take on a new challenge. Pick an Exercism? Tackle a problem on Project Euler?

### Technical Blogging

* Have you figured something out? Write a technical blog post. [Check out some of the posts written by your fellow students this week.](https://github.com/turingschool/student_blogging/blob/master/week%20of%202014-10-27.markdown) Keep in mind, that someone down the road will struggle with some concept you've recently conquered.

### Contribute to the Curriculum

* Can you add a new extension to a project you've previously completed (e.g. IdeaBox, SalesEngne, etc.)?
* Is there something you wish was included in a tutorial? Open a pull request or create a new issue.
* Anything wrong with a tutorial? Go fix it for all the students who come after you!

### Learn Your Current Tools

**Travis** is running a study group. He'll be in the classroom A workspace by the 3D printer.

* Figure out how to split your windows in your current editor of choice (unless it's TextMate).
* Does your editor support multiple cursors? Probably. Figure out how to use them.
* Create snippets/macros in your text editor for things you use all of the time.
* Set up keyboard short cuts for resizing and positioning your windows.
* Set your text editor to use spaces instead of tabs.
* Set your text editor to automatically delete trailing whitespace.

### Experiment with New Tools

* Level up your git skills with Scott Chacon's [_Pro Git_](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
* Try out a visual git tool like [Github for Mac][ghfm], [GitX][gitx], [Tower][].
* Find a tool that allows you to use multiple clipboards ([Keyboard Maestro][km], [Flycut][fc]).
* Play with [RubyMine][rm]—a Ruby/Rails IDE.

### Play with a New Language

* Choose a language from [Learn X in Y Minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com)
* [Try Clojure](http://www.tryclj.com)
* [Try Elixir](http://try-elixir.herokuapp.com)
* [A Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/#1)

### Contribute to Miniature Octo Ironman

* Interested in playing with [Docker][docker] or [Panamax][panamax]? How about seeing if we can't get a safe Ruby environment to evaluate code in? **Jonmichael** has already opened up an issue [here][docker-sandbox] and will be hacking on it this morning—find him if you're interested.
* Got some CSS skills? [Help us out][moi-css]!
* Found the zen of JavaScript? How about [improving ours][moi-js]!
