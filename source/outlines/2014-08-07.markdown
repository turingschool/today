## Everyone

We'll skip warmup this morning since you're likely
preoccupied with the assignments you have due today.

### Morning Work Time (9:00-Noon)

You have the morning to finish up your projects.

For 1406, if you finish your game, consider (a)
refactoring to improve the code quality or (b) trying
an extension *in a feature branch*.

For 1407, if you finish ContactManager, delete the
implementation of one or more controller methods and
see if you can reimplement it without guidance.

### Showcase (3:30-4:00)

This afternoon we'll have a showcase to show off Blogger,
ContactManager, Battleship, and Mastermind. If you've
built something you're ready to show off, please add your
name to the front whiteboard.

### ContactManager Group Wrapup (1:00-3:30)

To close out ContactManager we'll do a mix of full-group review
and refactor session.

## 1407

### Game Evaluations (1:00-3:30)

This afternoon you'll meet with an instructor to evaluate
your project.
