### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

Isaac and Albert were excitedly describing the result of the Third Annual International Science Fair Extravaganza in Sweden. There were three contestants, Louis, Rene, and Johannes. Isaac reported that Louis won the fair, while Rene came in second. Albert, on the other hand, reported that Johannes won the fair, while Louis came in second.

In fact, neither Isaac nor Albert had given a correct report of the results of the science fair. Each of them had given one correct statement and one false statement. What was the actual placing of the three contestants?

### Echo - Superfizz Recap (9:00 - 9:30)

Meet Josh in the front of Classroom A.

### Echo - String and Integer Riddles (9:30 - 10:30)

Continue with Josh in the front of Classroom A.

NOTE: If you don't know what strings / integers are, let me know.

Launch pry and see what methods exist on a string:

(if yours doesn't work: `$ gem install pry` and try again)

    [1] pry(main)> string = "hello"
    => "hello"

    [2] pry(main)> ls string
    Comparable#methods: <  <=  >  >=  between?
    String#methods:
      %            chr             gsub       rindex       succ!
      *            clear           gsub!      rjust        sum
    # ...

As you work your way through this, think about what names you might choose
to for the methods that do these jobs. Then see if those names are in the list.
If they are, try them out and see if they give you what you expect.

* Build [SuperFizz](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/super_fizz.markdown)
* Remember head shots tomorrow

### Echo: Homework

* Find a way to improve the environment before you leave today.
  Take a level of ownership as if this was your home, and empower yourself to make something better.
  Maybe you see someone struggling with something and you can offer help (opening a door,
  figuring out a challenge, installing their environment).
  Maybe you see something that is causing an issue for students generally (a full trash can,
  a furniture layout that is causing logistical issues, a cord that people are tripping over,
  an empty pot of coffee, an issue with the scavenger hunt implementation).
  Whatever it is, empower yourself to improve it, and do so.
  Make the environment better for others, and express appreciation as they make it better for you.
  Invest in your community.
* [Strings and Integers quiz](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/strings_and_integers_quiz.markdown)
* Headshots tomorrow
