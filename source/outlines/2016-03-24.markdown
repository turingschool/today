### On Dependencies (9:00 - 12:00)

This morning work through [this assignment](https://gist.github.com/rrgayhart/a3517e56174270c3c3e7) based on some recent drama in the developer community.

### Ideabox Review (1:00 - 4:00)

'Pencils down' (i.e. no more commits) on IdeaBox’s master branch by noon today - but you can work on any refactors on a different branch and we can talk about them at evals next week if you want to.

Steve will send out a link to a tutorial based around his implementation of IdeaBox at noon that you’ll be working on for the afternoon.

### The Plan

For those that are present at Turing, let's meet in Classroom C at 9:00 for a brief chat to put together a plan for the day. We want to get a sense of how many students are remote and how many are in the building.

One on ones have been moved to Tuesday next week, during the time previously reserved for check-ins. Check-ins will move to Monday afternoon.

If you had a one on one with Allison today, she will reach out and reschedule.

Tomorrow's instructional time (Intermediate SQL) will be assigned as homework due tomorrow morning.

### Homework

Work through the [Intermediate SQL](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/intermediate_sql.md) tutorial.

*Submitting your work:* Keep a gist with the queries you write.

Answer the following questions:

* What is an INNER JOIN?
* What is a LEFT OUTER JOIN?
* What is a RIGHT OUTER JOIN?`

When you're finished, open a PR to the following [Ruby Submission file.](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1511/homework/intermediate_sql.md) with your link.

*Why is this homework important?* I'm glad you asked. As you use ActiveRecord it is easy to forget what is happening at the SQL level. The level of complexity is going to continue to increase over the next couple weeks and having a base to build on is important. We'll have a discussion tomorrow to answer questions you may have. The gist will serve as a nice reference as you work through The Pivot and RailsEngine.

### Introduction to SQL (9:30 - 10:30)

Same broadcast - new material. Let's start class with a basic rundown of SQL.

Then

We'll do an SQL challenge. It's based on the [fundamental SQL tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/fundamental_sql.html#stq=&stp=0) so if you didn't get all the way through that, go ahead and finish it first.

[Here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/explore_sql.md) is the challenge.


### Intro to Sequel (10:30 - 12:00)

[Here are the slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/75t98l4lnmr1ub4/intro_to_sequel.key?dl=0)

After the quick intro to Sequel we'll work through [Getting Started With Sequel](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/sequel.html)
