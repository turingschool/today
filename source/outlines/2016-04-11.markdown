### Fecho: Building Desktop Applications: Kickoff and Q & A (9:00 - 10:00)

You'll be working in the following pairs:

- Shannon Page and Jamie Crockett
- Justin Pease and Dan Winter
- Steve Pentler and Jordan Lawler
- Joseph Perry and Brenna Martenson
- Greg Armstrong

This morning, we'll discuss the following:

- Why we're using Electron for this project
- Scoping your project appropriately
- A brief tour of the scaffolding
- Some thoughts on Flexbox and Fetch
- What libraries you can and can't use
- Biased opinions on CSS frameworks designed to make your application look like a native OS X application

You should aim to have the following done by the end of the day:

- Wireframes for your application
- Detailed plans for your hopes and dreams
- Detailed plans for an MVP in case your hopes are dashed and your dreams deferred
- An initial spike of your application

The tutorials and videos below should help you get acclimated to using Electron. If you haven't reviewed them, then that's something you should *definitely* do today.

- [Introductory Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbSvc8_BHaw&feature=youtu.be)
- **Fire Sale**: [Tutorial](https://github.com/stevekinney/firesale-tutorial), [Video](https://vimeo.com/155240396)
- **Clipmaster 9000**: [Tutorial](https://github.com/stevekinney/clipmaster-9000-tutorial), [Video](https://vimeo.com/157959282)

You can use either of the following to get your project off the ground:

- [Steve's super simple starter kit](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/electron-react-starter-kit)
- [The more intense Electron-React boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)

Contributing to Open Source:

- Last inning, we created and contributed to [file-bin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-bin)—a simple little library that makes it easier to work with the file system in Node. There is still plenty of work to do. On Tuesday, we'll talk a but about how to create our own packages as well.
