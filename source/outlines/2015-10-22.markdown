### When You're Not Doing Your Project Eval (9:00 - 12:00)

*Start* with the Week 2 Diagnostic to help you get a measure of your progress. Work individually, closed book, closed computer. The papers will be at the front of Classroom A. Leave your completed submissions face down next to the fresh copies. You should finish it in well under an hour.

Then *Foxtrotters* need to [work through this Encryptor tutorial](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/encryptor.markdown).

And *Echoes* need to [build a linked list](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown). Check out the resources linked there and, if you're struggling, you can code along with [this iterative approach](https://vimeo.com/77857409).

Finally gather back in Classroom A at 11:40 to recap your diagnostic.
