## Everyone

### Friday Cleanup (8:15-9:00)

First up this morning let's...

* have a bit of community breakfast thanks to our friends at CoverMyMeds
* work on cleaning out the fridge
* clean up our room (put things back, clean up wiring, etc)

### Guest: Katrina Owen (9:00-10:15)

This morning we'll be joined by our good friend Katrina Owen. You can
find out more about Ben here:

* [On Twitter](https://twitter.com/kytrinyx)
* [On GitHub](https://github.com/kytrinyx)

Some things that you might want to ask Katrina about include:

* What reflections does she have now being six-months removed from teaching
gSchool?
* What's it been like to be someone who got into programming "late"?
* How has working in Go day-to-day for the past few months affected the way
she thinks and solves problems?

### Sudoku Throwdown (10:15-11:00)

Lightning talks? We don't need no stinkin' lightning talks!

This morning let's jump into an interesting algorithmic problem: a Sudoku solver. You won't get it built in the hour, but see if you can finish it today.

* Write an algorithm and implementation that can solve any deterministic Sudoku.
* Start with **simple elements** and build up
* If you're not familiar with the problem, [read about it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)
* There are many sources for sample boards, [here's one](http://www.nikoli.com/en/puzzles/sudoku/)
* You're welcome to work in pairs or solo at your discretion.
* Of course you should be using TDD and good Ruby practices along the way

### Retrospective (11:00-12:00)

* 1406 will have group conversation first 11:00-11:30
* 1407 will have group conversation second 11:30-12:00

When you're not having your group conversation, write a personal retrospective
addressing one or more of the following questions:

* **1406**: You worked hard on Blogger & ContactManager over the past week. Did you do them "well"? How do you know? What things do you feel strong in, and which feel week?
* **1407**: The games were a tough challenge. What were your thoughts about the group's achievement after evaluations and showcase yesterday? Where do you feel you stand in relation to your peers? Is that where you belong?
* You're halfway through this class. Where are your skills going to be in three weeks? What could you build on your own right now, and what do you think you'll be able to do then? How do you think you'll do in the assessment in the last week?
* We can't really push you through learning, you have to make your own way. What resources (technological, physical, human, etc) are you taking advantage of to propel/accelerate your learning? What can you make better use of? How will you do it?
