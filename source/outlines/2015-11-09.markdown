### Scale-Up Evaluations

When you're not being evaluated, read the first chapter of
[Node.js The Right Way](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6pa1dgactbcq4ku/NodeJSTheRightWayChap1.pdf?dl=1).

Use Redis to build a notifications service in Rails by working the [Building a Notification Service][bns] tutorial. We'll be exploring Redis in a little more depth tomorrow.

### Little Shop Kickoff (9:30 - 12:00)

Join Rachel in Classroom B to kick off [Little Shop of Orders](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown). 

Create a [team expectations](https://gist.github.com/rwarbelow/0fed3529495a814eabb1) document by forking the original. 

* John Slota & Amber Crawford & Shannon Paige 
* Edgar Duran & Matt Rooney & Matt Stjernholm

You'll have ~30 minutes to brainstorm your Little Shop idea with your group. When you're ready to pitch your idea, sign up on the whiteboard for a slot with Rachel. 

Next steps:

* generate a new Rails project for your little shop (don't forget to use Postgres for your database)
* create a waffle.io and add Rachel (rwarbelow) and Andrew (Carmer) as collaborators
* push to Heroku (get in the habit of pushing to Heroku frequently)
* create wireframes for most important views: Think about what you think the workflow should be on the site. Which of those views is most important? In addition to the home page wireframe, create wireframes for the next two most important pages. Examples might be: A users' profile page, a product page, an admin dashboard etc.
