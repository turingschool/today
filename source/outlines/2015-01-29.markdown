### Project Evaluations (9:00 - 11:00)

#### With Steve and Ben

### Refactoring (11:00 - 12:00)

You're not done yet. It's time to make one last push based on your project evaluations.

### Cross-Cohort Pairing (1:00 - 3:00)

Some members of 1410 may have to step out briefly for project evaluations.

Use TDD to model a middle school student management application:

We'll set up the schema as follows:

* Teachers will have many students
* Students will have many teachers
* A teacher can have many assignments
* A student can have many assignments through their teachers
* An assignment can have a grade
* A student can have a grade on the assignment (through an `AssignmentGrade`)

Write the following model methods using ActiveRecord queries (and as little actual Ruby as possible):

* `Assignment` has an average grade.
* `Assignment` has a scope or class method that gets back the first 3 assignments sorted by `created_at`
* `Assignment` has a scope or class method that gets back the second 3 assignments sorted by `created_at`
* `Student` has an `average_grade` method that will show the average of all their grades on their assignments
* `Teacher` has a method that shows the 5 best performing students by grade
* `Teacher` has a method that shows the 5 best performing students by grade
* `Assignment` has a class method or scope that returns the top 10 assignments with the highest grade
* `Assignment` has a class method or scope that returns only the assignments created between one week ago and yesterday

Groups:

* With Kavita Sachdeva: Chris Luhring and Laura Whalin
