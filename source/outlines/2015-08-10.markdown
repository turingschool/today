### Echoes - SalesEngine the SQL

For your last week, Echoes, you'll build [SalesEngine the SQL](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine_the_sql.markdown).

You'll work individually but are welcome to pair with other students as long as you're both contributing/learning. For those of you who didn't pass SalesEngine, you'll continue with
your own codebase. Passing this SESQL project will stand in for SE in your portfolio assessment. For
those of you who did pass, you're going to rotate code bases with another
student and SESQL is just for the glory.

Base your SESQL off the following codebase in a new repo:

* George Hudson: http://github.com/russelleh/sales_engine
* Russell Harms: http://github.com/russelleh/sales_engine
* Matt Hecker: https://github.com/malonwais/sales_engine.git
* Alon Waisman: https://github.com/malonwais/sales_engine.git
* Justin Holzmann: https://github.com/plato721
* Ryan Ascencio: https://github.com/plato721
* Matt Ewell: http://github.com/philmphoenix/sales_engine_pivot
