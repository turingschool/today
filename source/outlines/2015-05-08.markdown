#### 1503: The Sisterhoold of the Traveling Sales Engines (10:00 - 11:00)

Join Josh, in Classroom A to laugh. Cry. Share the vision.

Our ambitious Sales Engine daydreams of JSON.
It daydreams of YAML.
It daydreams of data unfettered by file systems.
Consuming merchants and invoices from the farthest reaches of the internet.
We'll give it's wish a foundation, discover the internet, raise servers, transform mime types,
and ultimately, observe it grow up.
This is a coming of age story for our modest Sales Engine.
And in many ways, for us also, as the sultry songs of Sinatra
waft into our ears and ignite our imaginations for the very first time.
