### Load Testing and Production Performance Analysis (9:00 - 12:00)

Join Steve in Classroom A to look at some techniques for [scaling up our Ruby on Rails applications](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/load_testing_and_production_performance_monitoring.markdown).

You'll be working in the following pairs:

**Warm Up**: Before class begins, please create a Skylight account. Visit [https://www.skylight.io/](https://www.skylight.io/)
to sign up. We'll be using a free tier of the service, so you won't have to enter any payment information.

### Building a JavaScript Application from Scratch (1:00 - 2:00)

**Homework**: This morning, we spoke about setting up Skylight to track performance. Skylight is just one option. Another popular option is New Relic. Ideally, you would probably only use one of these in a project. That said, we'd like you to get comfotable with both.

1. Work through [this tutorial](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/performance_analysis_with_newrelic.markdown) on setting up New Relic on Blogger.
1. Set up New Relic on your Scale Up projects.
