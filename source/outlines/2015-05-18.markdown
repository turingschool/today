Monday morning. Your client shows up. "We got some funding", he says while putting his MBA feet on the table. "The Dinner Dash was great, but we need to change the Business Model". Your eyes widen in terror. "You have two weeks before TechCrunch Disrupt". You remember the broken tests, the fat controllers, the logic in the views. Your heart beats faster. "Good luck". He gets up, puts on his designer hoodie, and leaves the pre-reqs on the table.
