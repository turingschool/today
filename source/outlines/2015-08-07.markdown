### Guest Speaker (11:00 - 12:00)

This morning we're joined by a few fine folks from Mailchimp in Atlanta, but the
sacrificial question answerer will be Pete Holiday.

You can learn a bit about Pete on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/toomuchpete),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/pete-holiday/3/a5/b55),
[GitHub](https://github.com/toomuchpete), and
[his site](http://pete.holiday/).

Not familiar with [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com/)? Check out their
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailChimp), and
[twitter](https://twitter.com/mailchimp), and in our email tutorials you'll use their
[Mandrill service](https://www.mandrill.com/) for transactional email.

They also make some hats that people are kind of obsessed with:

### Group Retro (1:00 - 2:00)

* 1507 - Classroom A
* 1505 - Classroom C
* 1503 - Classroom B
* 1502 - Big Workspace

### One on Ones, Student Led Sessions, & Self-Study (2:00 - 4:00)

This afternoon we finally have a chunk of self study time. Hooray!

It's been a long week and you're probably a bit tired. The best idea
is to do some pairing and help each other stay focused. Maybe you want
to...

* Bend your brain with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)
* [Learn a bit about design for non-designers](https://hackdesign.org/)
* Experiment with an API you've never used before like [Twilio for voice/SMS](https://www.twilio.com/)
* Review the docs/code for an open source project like [the SQLite3 gem](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby) and try to make any contribution (like clarifying/adding examples to the README, trying to reproduce issues, etc). Note that the "SYNOPSIS" code can't actually all be run since it tries to `db.execute` an `INSERT` into the `students` table which hasn't been created yet. If you're into this work coordinate in #turing on Slack so multiple people aren't doing the same work.
