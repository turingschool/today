### Warm Up (8:30 - 8:50)

**Meet in your posses** to work on this logic problem:

There are four bungalows in a row. They are made from the following materials: straw, wood, brick and glass.

Raissa's bungalow is somewhere to the left of the wooden one and the third one along is brick.

Rachel owns a straw bungalow and Horace does not live at either end, but lives somewhere to the right of the glass bungalow.

Jorge lives in the fourth bungalow, whilst the first bungalow is not made from straw.

What order are the bungalows in and who lives in each bungalow?

### Homework

Tonight you need to build a solution to the [Credit Check Challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/credit_check.markdown).

* You'll use your solution in class tomorrow, so make sure it's done and works correctly.
* This is meant to be an independent exercise, but it's better to get a little help then to not complete it.
* Don't overreach by using tools/techniques we haven't covered yet. Building a simplistic solution is the point of the exercise.

**Submission**: Create a [gist](http://gist.github.com) and add the URL for your Gist to [this MoPad document](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/X8BxB5ir08).
