You may have seen that Turing is organized as a non-profit, expecting approval
as a 501(c)(3) from the IRS within the next 10 months. I frequently then get the
question *"how's that working out for you?"* And the answer is *"it's difficult."*
The paperwork, the accountability, not qualifying for things like SBA loans, etc.
Yes, I'm familiar with "B Corps", but they're not the same.

A big part of the 501(c)(3) decision was about investment -- **I'm against it**. I
bootstrapped [Jumpstart Lab](http://jumpstartlab.com) in 2009, so doing the same
with Turing just made sense. But if you look around you'll find developer education
programs taking investment left and right, some in the tens of millions of dollars.

That's a *big problem*. Investors don't give money away, *they expect it back*.
And in the tech world, they're looking for 10x return on investment. If they put
in 18 million dollars they're shooting for a payout of 180 million.

If you're running a software or content business, that works. Khan Academy or
Coursera can parlay investment dollars into new content that can reach millions
of learners -- that's awesome. If they're each willing to pay a few dollars then
the investors can hit their 10x no problem while realizing the educational goals.

But we're not in the content business, we're in a services business. Classrooms
don't scale in the same ways as software and content.

So where can 10x returns come from? **Student tuition**. For every dollar an investor puts
in they want *ten student dollars back*. That tuition paid into the system, instead
of paying for their instructors and facilities, pays investors. It compels the school to
raise tuition and cut costs. You raise your student/teacher ratio and use less
experienced instructors. Money sucked out of the ecosystem, diverted to the investors.

**What's right for investors is orthogonal to what's right for students**. If we claim
to be focused on the best possible outcomes for our students *and* take investment, then
then we're lying to one side or another. And the side with the smaller wallet is the
side that gets lied to.

Is it hard to bootstrap while watching competitors take on huge investments? Of
course. But this is too important. I've made compromises on my beliefs in the past,
and I paid a huge price. It won't happen again. This is our chance to do it right.

And no outsider, regardless of how deep their pockets, will call the shots.
