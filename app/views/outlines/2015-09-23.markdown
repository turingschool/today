### All: Loopback: Refactoring Enigma (9:00 - 10:30)

Join Josh in Classroom A.
We looked at how I'd approach the project, and several examples of code and refactoring them.
We saw that the core of the encryption and decryption algorithms are the same, and we can
swap between them by passing in a direction to rotate.

If you want to watch me solve the challenge, my code is here:
[https://github.com/JoshCheek/enigma](https://github.com/JoshCheek/enigma),
and there are videos of me doing each portion of it here:
[https://vimeo.com/channels/joshenigma](https://vimeo.com/channels/joshenigma).

If you want to get better at refactoring, specifically,
then you can go refactor my Enigma along with me, in this video: [https://vimeo.com/130882701](https://vimeo.com/130882701)
where we change this code: [http://bit.ly/1L1A1xY](http://bit.ly/1L1A1xY)
into this code: [http://bit.ly/1KJk5m1](http://bit.ly/1KJk5m1)

Or, you can go through the Blowing Bubbles 1 and 2 practice exercises,
here: [https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/tree/master/katas](https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/tree/master/katas)
each of these also has a video of me going through it so that you can see what it should look like.


### All: Testing Small Datasets and Edge Cases (10:30 - 12:00)

Stay in Classroom A.
We're going to talk about testing... where we'll discuss things that people advocate, what their advantages and disadvantages are,
and [create our own fictional story along the way!](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/testing_with_small_datasets…_the_fictional_story_of_a_plumber_who_learns_about_fixtures_mocks_and_stubs_and_ignoring_all_that_shit_and_simplifying_your_design_instead.markdown)

### All: Work Time (1:00 - 4:00)

Mike is available for questions.
