### Demo Night (5:30 - 7:00)

> Teams in 1410 created data aggregator services that pull data and activity from other applications and publishes it through both a web interface and an API.
>
> After their last project—Dinner Dash—the groups in 1412 were split up and reassembled. Each group inherited another group's project and told that their business had to pivot.

Make sure you RSVP so that Rachel and Steve can accurately overthink how much pizza to buy.
