### Binary Search Trees (9:00 - 12:00)

Meet with Jeff and Steve in Classroom A. We'll start with a quick exploration
of how Binary Search Trees work, then dive into implementations in Ruby and JavaScript.

#### Ruby Pairs

* Eric Dowty & Tracy Caruso
* Mihir Parikh & Michelle Golle
* Kristina Brown & Kenny Chen
* Patrick Medaugh & Fred Block
* David Daniel & Lori Culberson
* Minnie Lee & Andrew Carmer
* Kyle Henson & Thomas Leskin
* Tess Griffin

#### JavaScript Pairs

* Tracy Caruso & Thomas Leskin
* Mihir Parikh & Michelle Golle
* Fred Block & Minnie Lee
* Kristina Brown & Lori Culberson
* Kyle Henson & Kenny Chen
* David Daniel & Andrew Carmer
* Tess Griffin & Eric Dowty
* Patrick Medaugh

#### Resources

* [Reading a file in Node](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/d4299abea06e21153a92) (_TL;DR_ — you probably want to just pass in your numbers to your test.)

We'll work from [this Binary Search Tree project description](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown). In this short of time you realistically want to focus on `insert` and `include?`. If possible
it'd be great to implement `depth_of`.

### Project Work Time (1:00 - 2:30)

Work work.

### TIP (2:30 - 4:00)

Join Mike in the Workspace where you'll have [a difficult data structures challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/doubly_linked_circular_list.markdown
). Remember that this is interview prep -- it's supposed to be difficult but how
you attack the problem is more important that solving it.

### Understanding the Asset Pipeline (9:00 - 12:00)

Meet Jorge in Classroom B to learn about how Rails organizes and processes assets.

### Self-Directed Projects Kick Off (1:00 - 2:30)

Meet in Classroom B again. We will select your ideas, learn about personas and work on wireframes to kick off your personal project.

For this session, you must have:

* Read the assigned chapters of Pitching Hacks.
* Made three project proposals that solve an actual problem.
* Researched your API integrations and assessed the feasibility.
