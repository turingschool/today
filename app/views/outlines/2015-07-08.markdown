### Project Work Time (1:00 - 4:00)

Work work work.

### Cross-Cohort Project Collaboration (1:00 - 2:30)

We're trying a new experiment this afternoon with the goal of
getting more perspectives on your project work. For 90 minutes this afternoon,
pair up with a member of 1503 and work on a feature for their project.

We'll leave it somewhat up to you to determine how to spend this time,
but we recommend you spend 45 minutes tackling one of these topics on each of your projects:

1. Pair on a feature. Hopefully there is a well-written user story to guide your progress.
Don't forget your tests.
2. Refactoring or Improving Test Coverage. This could be espcially useful for the 1503 supper skippers among you...
3. Code Review (here are some [code review tips](https://gist.github.com/worace/60c38d49f32bda6a90bd))
4. Feature planning and design -- work through a conceptual plan for an upcoming
feature with your pair. Focus especially on schema design and data modeling. Try to think through
a few different ways you could store and access the relevant data for your feature.

And _yes_, Module 3 students are perfectly capable of reviewing and collaborating on Module 4
projects.

Here are the pairs to work in:

* Justin Holmes, Minnie Lee
* Chelsea Worrel, Tracy Caruso
* Andrew Fink, Kenny Chen
* Rick Bacci, Mihir Parikh
* Max Tedford, Thomas Leskin
* Morgan Miller, Andrew Carmer
* Margarett Ly, Kristina Brown
* Jamie Kawahara, David Daniel
* Rob Cornell, Michelle Golle
* Sally MacNicholas, Eric Dowty
* Jack Yeh, Lori Culberson
* Whitney Hiemstra, Patrick Medaugh
* Josh Cass, Kyle Henson
* Drew Reynolds, Dave Maurer
* Erik Butcher, Fred Block
* Lev Kravinsky, Tess Griffin
* Vanessa Gomez, Brett Grigsby

fair for other people who also may need help. Feel free to ask questions about questions.
