2 - Many people view recursion as an acid test for how well an individual understands computer programming.
Know recursion well enough to reach for it in a technical interview (not super hard don't worry)? \#Hired.
3 - Recursion is fun and produces awesome, clean code.

  benefit from applying these ideas to Software Projects.
* [Simplicity Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0) by
  Rich Hickey. This Railsconf keynote from a few years ago digs into the
  inherent problem of complexity in software systems. Rich discusses
  some ways we consistently get things wrong, and offers some ideas of
  how to do better.
* [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)
